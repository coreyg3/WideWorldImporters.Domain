# WideWorldImporters.Domain.Tests

## Overview

This test suite provides comprehensive unit testing for the **WideWorldImporters.Domain** project, covering all critical business logic, validation rules, and architectural patterns. The tests are designed to ensure the domain model is robust and ready for NuGet packaging.

## Test Coverage

### Current Status
- **Total Tests**: 143
- **Passing Tests**: 143 (100%)
- **Failed Tests**: 0
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of core domain entities and value objects

### Tested Components

#### Value Objects
- **Address** - Immutability, validation, equality semantics
- **LineFinancials** - Complex financial calculations, business rules, consistency validation
- **ContactInformation** - Required field validation, URL validation

#### Domain Entities
- **Customer** - Complete lifecycle, business methods, validation rules, state transitions
- **Order** - Order workflow, picking process, status transitions, calculated properties

#### Test Infrastructure
- **TestDataBuilder** - Centralized test data creation with consistent defaults
- **Helper Methods** - Reusable patterns for entity construction and validation

## Test Architecture

### Design Principles

Our test suite follows these foundational principles that align with your INTP preferences:

1. **Logical Structure**: Tests are organized by conceptual areas (construction, validation, business logic, etc.)
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every business rule, validation, and edge case is explicitly tested
3. **Clear Intent**: Each test has a single, well-defined purpose with descriptive naming
4. **Systematic Approach**: Tests follow consistent patterns and use shared infrastructure

### Testing Patterns

#### Value Object Testing
- **Construction validation** - All required parameters and constraints
- **Immutability verification** - Properties are read-only, no mutation allowed
- **Equality semantics** - Value-based equality, hash code consistency
- **Business logic** - Calculations, derivations, and business rules
- **Edge cases** - Boundary conditions, null handling, format validation

#### Entity Testing
- **Construction scenarios** - Valid parameters, optional parameters, defaults
- **Validation rules** - All business constraints and error conditions
- **Business methods** - State transitions, business logic, side effects
- **Calculated properties** - Derived values, status indicators, classifications
- **Workflow testing** - Multi-step processes, state machine behavior
- **Infrastructure methods** - ID assignment, temporal properties

## Key Testing Strategies

### 1. Comprehensive Business Rule Coverage

Every business rule in the domain is explicitly tested:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void PlaceOnCreditHold_WhenAlreadyOnHold_ThrowsInvalidOperationException()
{
    // Ensures business invariants are maintained
}

[Theory]
[InlineData(-1)]
[InlineData(101)]
public void Constructor_WithInvalidDiscountPercentage_ThrowsArgumentException(decimal invalidDiscount)
{
    // Tests all boundary conditions systematically
}
```

### 2. State Transition Testing

Complex workflows like Order picking are thoroughly tested:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void OrderStatus_ReturnsCorrectStatus()
{
    // Tests the complete state machine:
    // Pending → Picking → Picked
}
```

### 3. Financial Calculation Validation

The `LineFinancials` value object includes sophisticated validation:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Constructor_WithInconsistentExtendedPrice_ThrowsArgumentException()
{
    // Ensures financial integrity across all calculations
}
```

### 4. Edge Case and Error Handling

Every validation rule and error condition is tested:

```csharp
[Theory]
[InlineData(null)]
[InlineData("")]
[InlineData("   ")]
public void Constructor_WithInvalidCustomerName_ThrowsArgumentException(string? invalidName)
{
    // Systematic testing of all invalid input scenarios
}
```

## Architectural Benefits

### Domain-Driven Design Validation

The tests validate key DDD patterns:

- **Value Object Immutability**: Ensures value objects cannot be modified after creation
- **Entity Identity**: Tests that entities are equal based on ID, not state
- **Business Logic Encapsulation**: Validates that business rules are properly enforced
- **Aggregate Boundaries**: Tests respect the foreign key ID approach

### Foreign Key ID Pattern Testing

Tests verify the architectural decision to use IDs instead of navigation properties:

```csharp
// Tests validate that entities reference others by ID only
Assert.Equal(TestDataBuilder.ValidCustomerId, order.CustomerId);
// Not: Assert.Equal(customer, order.Customer);
```

### Financial Integrity

The `LineFinancials` tests ensure mathematical consistency:

- Extended price = Unit price × Quantity
- Tax amount = Extended price × Tax rate
- All calculations maintain precision and consistency

## Quality Assurance for NuGet Packaging

### Pre-Packaging Checklist

✅ **All Tests Passing**: 143/143 tests pass consistently  
✅ **Business Logic Coverage**: All domain rules tested  
✅ **Validation Coverage**: All input validation tested  
✅ **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error cases covered  
✅ **Value Object Patterns**: Immutability and equality tested  
✅ **Entity Lifecycle**: Creation, updates, state transitions tested  
✅ **Architectural Patterns**: Foreign key IDs and DDD patterns validated  

### Recommended Testing Before Release

1. **Run Full Test Suite**: `dotnet test` should show 100% pass rate
2. **Performance Testing**: Validate entity creation and calculation performance
3. **Integration Testing**: Test with actual EF Core implementation
4. **Serialization Testing**: Verify JSON serialization works correctly

## Testing Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
Every test follows the clear three-phase structure for maximum readability.

### 2. Descriptive Naming
Test names clearly indicate the scenario being tested and expected outcome.

### 3. Single Responsibility
Each test validates exactly one behavior or business rule.

### 4. Test Data Management
Centralized `TestDataBuilder` provides consistent, valid test data across all tests.

### 5. Theory-Based Testing
`[Theory]` attributes systematically test multiple input scenarios.

## Extending the Test Suite

### For Additional Entities

When adding tests for new entities, follow this pattern:

1. **Create entity-specific test class**
2. **Add construction tests** (valid parameters, validation)
3. **Add business method tests** (state changes, calculations)
4. **Add calculated property tests** (derived values)
5. **Add equality and infrastructure tests**
6. **Update TestDataBuilder** with helper methods

### For Additional Value Objects

1. **Test immutability** (readonly properties)
2. **Test equality semantics** (value-based equality)
3. **Test validation rules** (constructor constraints)
4. **Test business logic** (calculations, derivations)
5. **Test edge cases** (nulls, boundaries, formats)

## Conclusion

This test suite provides a solid foundation for packaging the WideWorldImporters.Domain as a NuGet package. The comprehensive coverage ensures:

- **Reliability**: All business rules are validated
- **Maintainability**: Changes can be verified against existing behavior
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications
- **Confidence**: New consumers can trust the domain logic

The tests validate both the functional correctness and architectural integrity of the domain model, making it production-ready for distribution.
